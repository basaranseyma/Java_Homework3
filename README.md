# Hero of Alexandria üèõ
Let's say you have a triangle with known lengths for all three sides, and you want to calculate its area. In our assignment on [Patika.dev](https://patika.dev), we were asked to write a Java program to do this using a formula. Thanks to [Hero of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria), I could complete this assignment.

I used his formula called [Heron's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula).

Enter the lengths, and the program will calculate the area for you.
